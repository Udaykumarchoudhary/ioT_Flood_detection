# ioT_Flood_detection
Flooding is a significant problem in many parts of India. Each monsoon season, considerable loss 
of life and property is caused by floods in many areas. With timely monitoring of the situation 
and analysis of the data, we can take preparatory measures and prevent the loss. The remote
location and unavailability of experts and computing facilities at the observation site make it 
challenging to draw valuable insights and make a guess about emerging situations. With the help 
of IoT systems, such obstacles can be overcome. 
This project aims to implement a basic IoT system that senses water level data at the site and 
sends it to the server. From there, actuators, e.g., dam gates or alarm alerts, can be manipulated 
to control dangerous situations. This project demonstrates that IoT systems can be helpful for the 
said purpose, and scalable and more complex systems can be built following the methodologies 
used here.
